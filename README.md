# System Analyzer Dashboard ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ“Š

The easiest way to analyze the efficiency of a server is by using various plots.

The idea:
1. User provides input server path where profile files stored.
2. The `System Analyzer Dashboard ` constructs a data frame form profile files, which helps to create various plots and these plots tell us the performance of server. 

## Overview 
This Python-based system analyzer dashboard application allows users to view server performance through various informative plots.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore server performance through engaging graph plots you can directly interact with to zoom, filter, and customize your view.
- **Platform Agnostic:** Monitor the health of a wide range of servers
- **Data Export:** Easily download graphs.
